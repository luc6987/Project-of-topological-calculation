# Project-of-topological-calculation
A repository for the project of CSC_42021_EP - Conception et analyse d'algorithmes (2024-2025)

Matias Ollu, Yuguang Yao

Here are the documents you can find and its purposes:

## Tasks.py
this file contains the most essentials algoritm of our project containing 

* Circumcircle of $n$ Points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($n \leq d+1$)
* Minimal Enclosing Ball(MEB)
* task3 Enumeration of ÄŒech-complex
* task5 Enumeration of alpha-complex and its filtration values

# test.py
This file contains the essential test to answer the request in the demands.

# plots.py
This file contains a basic framework to plot and the fonctions to plot the output in Tasks.

# extension_tasks.py
This file contains a expends mathode to resolve task3 and task5, but lack of test and adjust under cases of higher dimension.
